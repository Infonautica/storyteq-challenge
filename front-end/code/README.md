# frontend

## Summary

The project is based on vue-start and includes the following features:

- TypeScript
- Eslint
- Vue 3
- Pinia
- Vite

## My notes

The world is complex enough, so i personally started to lean towards simplicity.
It then starts to be reflected in my code, so you may find things like:

- A simple and minimalistic UI
- HTML based autofocus instead of JS one
- Datalist with suggestions instead of custom solutions
- Single purpose functions
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Clear and simple naming conventions
- etc.

## CLI Instructions
