# frontend

## Summary

The project is based on vue-start and includes the following features:

- TypeScript
- Vue 3
- Pinia
- Vite

## My notes

The world is complex enough, so i personally started to lean towards simplicity.
My vision of the world will obviously be reflected in my code, so you may find things like:

- A simple and minimalistic UI
- HTML based autofocus instead of JS one
- Datalist with suggestions instead of custom solutions
- Single purpose functions
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Clear and simple naming concentions
- etc.
